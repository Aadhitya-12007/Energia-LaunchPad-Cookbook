Choose Tiva C if your priority is high performance. You need a 32-bit MCU with an FPU and plenty of connectivity options for a computationally intensive application like motor control or advanced signal processing.

Choose MSP430 if your priority is battery life. If you are designing a low-power, battery-operated device where the MCU spends most of its time in a low-power state, the MSP430 is the most efficient option.

Choose CC3200 if your priority is wireless connectivity. This is the clear winner for any project that needs integrated Wi-Fi and secure internet protocols without adding an external wireless module.
