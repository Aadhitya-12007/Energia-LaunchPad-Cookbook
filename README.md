Energia Projects for MSP430 & CC3200 LaunchPads

A comprehensive collection of Energia IDE projects, code examples, and tutorials for Texas Instruments (TI) MSP430 and CC3200 LaunchPad MCUs. This repository is perfect for students, hobbyists, and professionals working on IoT and embedded systems.

ðŸŽ¯ About This Repository

This repository serves as a practical "cookbook" for anyone developing with Texas Instruments MSP430 and CC3200 SimpleLink Wi-Fi LaunchPads using the Energia IDE. Energia simplifies development by providing an Arduino-like framework for TI microcontrollers, making it easy to go from idea to prototype.

The code examples here range from basic "Hello, World" style programs (like blinking an LED) to more advanced applications involving sensor integration, communication protocols, and Internet of Things (IoT) concepts.

Hardware Covered:

TI MSP430 LaunchPad series (e.g., MSP-EXP430G2)

TI CC3200 SimpleLink Wi-Fi LaunchPad (CC3200-LAUNCHXL)

âœ¨ Key Features

Beginner-Friendly: Clear, well-commented code perfect for learning.

Practical Examples: Code snippets that solve real-world problems.

Wide Coverage: Covers GPIO, ADC, Timers, I2C, SPI, UART, and Wi-Fi.

IoT Ready: Includes examples for HTTP clients, web servers, and MQTT on the CC3200.

Easy to Use: Designed to work out-of-the-box with the Energia IDE.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the example projects running on your LaunchPad.
